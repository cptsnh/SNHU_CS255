## DriverPass Project Summarization
Our project throughout the course was based on the client DriverPass, and their desire to implement an online driver training system. DriverPass has identified a void in the marketplace with regards to providing training to people who need to take the driving exam at their local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). The system they are proposing is intended to make driving training easily accessible on the web and available on mobile, laptop, and personal computing devices. Our task was to perform system analysis and design that will lead to implementing the system.

## What I did well
We completed two main documents as part of this effort. This included a Business Requirements Document and a System Design Document. I feel like I did very well at completing both documents. The BRD is used to identify the components, function and nonfunctional requirements, platform constraints, user interface functionality, assumptions and limitations associated with the system. I also completed a Gantt chart showing the timeline and critical path for the project. I completed multiple diagrams as part of the system design document, which included activity diagrams, a class diagram, a sequence diagram, and a use case diagram. The SDD also identified technical requirements of the system. Overall, I spent a lot of time on these documents, and I am proud of my work.

## Document Revision
A document I would like to revise would be the technical requirements identified in the SDD. The technical requirements included a cloud-based solution. I donâ€™t have much experience with cloud-based solutions, so I would improve this area by gaining more experience using Azure. For example, building a server or a workstation virtual machine, and even writing a basic application in the cloud. Then, based on that experience, I would update the technical requirements with more detail.

## Software Design Approach
This course was a great experience. We learned probably some of the most important ways to approach designing software. First, software development typically follows a software development life cycle (SDLC). At high-level, it includes planning, analysis, design, implementation, and maintenance. Second, as part of analysis and design, we aim at understanding the system from various perspectives to attempt describing it as fully possible. For example, using behavioral, structural, and functional models, we can view the system in different ways. Based on the models, we can gain a better understanding of the system for analysis and design. The strategy I would use in the future is to do more modeling before actually starting a project.
